### Capacitated Bus 
> There are n passengers 1, 2, …, n.
> The passenger i want to travel from point i to point i + n (i =1,2,…,n).
> There is a bus located at point 0 and has k places for transporting the passengers (it means at any time, there are at most k passengers on the bus).
> You are given the distance matrix c in which c(i,j) is the traveling distance from point i to point j (i, j = 0,1,…, 2n).
> Compute the shortest route for the bus, serving n passengers and coming back to point 0.

> **Input**
> - Line 1 contains n and k (1≤n≤11,1≤k≤10)
> - Line i+1 (i=1,2,…,2n+1) contains the (i−1)th line of the matrix c (rows and columns are indexed from 0,1,2,..,2n).

> **Output**
> Unique line contains the length of the shortest route.
