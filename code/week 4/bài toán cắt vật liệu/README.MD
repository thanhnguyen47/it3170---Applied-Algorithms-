### Cut Material 
> Given a material having the shape rectangle with height H and width W.
> We need to cut this material into n smaller rectangle submaterials of size (h1,w1), (h2, w2), ..., (hn, wn).
> Write a program to check if we can perform this cut.

> *** Input ***
> *Line 1:* contains two positive integers H, W (1 <= H, W <= 10)
> *Line 2:* contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 10)
> *Line i+2:* (i= 1,...,n): contains two positive integer hi and wi (1 <= hi, wi <= 10)

> *** Output ***
> Write 1 if we can perform the cut and write 0, otherwise.
